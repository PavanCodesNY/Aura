# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the UI Component Generator from a React-only tool into a multi-framework code generation platform. Users will be able to generate the same UI components in React, Vue 3, Svelte, Angular, and Vanilla JavaScript, allowing developers to work with their preferred framework while maintaining consistent component functionality and design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select different frontend frameworks from a dropdown, so that I can generate components in my preferred technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the code viewer THEN I SHALL see a framework selector dropdown in the header
2. WHEN I click the framework dropdown THEN I SHALL see options for React, Vue 3, Svelte, Angular, and Vanilla JS
3. WHEN I select a different framework THEN the code SHALL update immediately to show the equivalent component in that framework
4. WHEN I select a framework THEN the file extension SHALL update accordingly (.tsx, .vue, .svelte, .ts, .js)
5. WHEN I switch frameworks THEN my selection SHALL be persisted for the current session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see framework-specific syntax highlighting, so that the generated code is properly formatted and readable for each technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view React code THEN I SHALL see JSX and TypeScript syntax highlighting
2. WHEN I view Vue code THEN I SHALL see template, script, and style block highlighting
3. WHEN I view Svelte code THEN I SHALL see component-specific syntax highlighting
4. WHEN I view Angular code THEN I SHALL see decorator and TypeScript class highlighting
5. WHEN I view Vanilla JS code THEN I SHALL see modern JavaScript syntax highlighting
6. WHEN I switch between frameworks THEN the syntax highlighting SHALL update immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want equivalent functionality across all frameworks, so that I can achieve the same interactive behavior regardless of my chosen technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate a magnetic button THEN it SHALL have cursor-following behavior in all frameworks
2. WHEN I generate a glowing card THEN it SHALL have mouse-tracking glow effects in all frameworks
3. WHEN I generate a minimal input THEN it SHALL have focus animations in all frameworks
4. WHEN I generate a toggle switch THEN it SHALL have smooth state transitions in all frameworks
5. WHEN I generate a loading spinner THEN it SHALL have consistent animations in all frameworks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual indicators of the current framework, so that I always know which technology I'm working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a framework THEN I SHALL see the framework name in the code viewer header
2. WHEN I select a framework THEN I SHALL see the appropriate file extension displayed
3. WHEN I select a framework THEN I SHALL see a framework icon or logo indicator
4. WHEN I copy code THEN the filename SHALL include the correct extension for the selected framework
5. WHEN I switch frameworks THEN all visual indicators SHALL update consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts for quick framework switching, so that I can efficiently switch between technologies without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Cmd+1 THEN I SHALL switch to React framework
2. WHEN I press Cmd+2 THEN I SHALL switch to Vue 3 framework
3. WHEN I press Cmd+3 THEN I SHALL switch to Svelte framework
4. WHEN I press Cmd+4 THEN I SHALL switch to Angular framework
5. WHEN I press Cmd+5 THEN I SHALL switch to Vanilla JS framework
6. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN the framework SHALL switch immediately with visual feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to understand framework context, so that it can provide framework-specific guidance and suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask for a component in a specific framework THEN the AI SHALL generate appropriate framework-specific code
2. WHEN I request modifications THEN the AI SHALL understand the current framework context
3. WHEN I ask framework-specific questions THEN the AI SHALL provide relevant answers
4. WHEN I switch frameworks THEN the AI SHALL adapt its responses to the new framework context
5. WHEN I generate components THEN the AI SHALL use framework-appropriate terminology and patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent component previews regardless of framework, so that I can see how the component will look and behave before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch frameworks THEN the live preview SHALL remain consistent
2. WHEN I interact with the preview THEN the behavior SHALL be identical across frameworks
3. WHEN I generate a new component THEN the preview SHALL work regardless of selected framework
4. WHEN I view component statistics THEN they SHALL be accurate for the selected framework
5. WHEN I copy code THEN the preview SHALL continue to function normally

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for framework switching, so that the application remains stable when switching between technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a framework fails to load THEN I SHALL see a helpful error message
2. WHEN switching frameworks fails THEN I SHALL fall back to the previous working framework
3. WHEN invalid framework data exists THEN I SHALL see appropriate validation errors
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN I SHALL still be able to use cached framework templates
5. WHEN syntax highlighting fails THEN I SHALL still see readable code without highlighting
